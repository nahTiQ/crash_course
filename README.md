Module containing all of the classes in 'Python Crash Course' by Eric Matthes.

Honestly, you shouldn't be using this and if you are you're a filthy cheater. =P

There are some variences from the expected file than if it was copied verbatim from the book. I expanded on 
some of the classes myself for practice and to explore the world of python. All of the code works, but the output
may be a little different than you're expecting when following along with the book. The method and class
names are the same, however, so you can still use the same method and class names. There are also extras if you
care to go through the code.

Using this file completely ignores the import lessons in the book, which is an easy enough concept to grasp, so
I don't think you'll be hurt too much by using this file.

-- TO USE --
Save this file as book_examples.py in the same folder you're writing your code from the book in.
At the top of your main code file, put this as the first line to call on the classes and methods within:
from book_examples import *

From here, you can follow the book without worrying about having to rewrite the code in the classes.
You __SHOULD__ rewrite the code in the classes for learning experience, but I created this to learn
myself. Honestly, using this will probably hurt you more than help you in the long run, but I'm not
your dad, so /shrug
